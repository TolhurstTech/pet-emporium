## W3C CSS Validation

I used W3C to validate my CSS and fix any conformity errors.

## JSLint JavaScript Validation
I validated all my JS scripts with JSLint. A couple of minor errors were left as I didn't put some logic inside functions leaving some global variables and didn't quite have time to fix that at this stage.

## W3C HTML Validation
Validated the html both in logged in and logged out states as the html is slightly different for both.
I also validated the html with a full basket to test for errors there, too, and found some that don't show on an empty basket.
I found some errors in different states and cleaned them all up.
